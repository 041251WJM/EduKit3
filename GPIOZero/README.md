# EduKit3 GPIO Zero Instructions

These instructions allow you to program your EduKit 3 Robot using GPIOZero. GPIO Zero is a Python library simplifying the use of the GPIO pins. You can find out more about GPIOZero in the [GPIOZero documentation](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

Using the instructions below you can build a simple line following robot or a robot that will avoid obstacles.

## Step 0: Installing GPIOZero

if you are using Raspbian Jessie GPIOZero is installed by Default.

If you are using an older version of Raspbian you will need to install the library manually. The documentation has the [instructions for manual installation](https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing.html) 

## Step 1: Build the robot

## Step 2: Test the motors

## Step 3: Test the Line Sensor

## Step 4: Follow a Line

## Step 5: Avoid an Obstacle

## Step 6: What next?
