# Worksheet 6 â€“ Measuring Distance GPIO Zero

# Define GPIO pins to use on the Pi

# Repeat the next indented block forever
while True:
    #print the distance in meters
    print('Distance: ', sensor.distance * 100) #check this lin GPIO Zero documentattion says distance gives distance in meters but the multiplies by 100 here to get meters?
    sleep(0.5)

# If you press CTRL+C, cleanup and stop
except KeyboardInterrupt:
